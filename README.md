# Exploring Weather Trends
This project was completed as part of the course requirements of Udacity's [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) certification.

## Overview
The project explored annual global temperature trends from the 1700s to 2000s and compared these to trends in six Canadian cities.

### Statistical Analysis
- Moving average
- Correlation, including p-value calculations and variance discussion
- T-tests
- Linear regression and prediction with confidence intervals

## Technologies Used
- SQL
- Excel

## Key Findings
- Shared/different geography appears to influence temperature variations
- Canadian cities are colder than the global average
- Global temperatures strongly correlate with, and can be used the predict (with 95% confidence intervals) changes in, city temperatures
- Global temperatures have seen a sharp increase since 1980 compared to the previous 200 years
